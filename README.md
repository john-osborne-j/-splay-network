# Splay Network: Wildlife Tracking & Detection

This application simulates a Splay Network of sensor nodes and integrates a real-time wildlife detection pipeline using:
- **YOLOv8** for Object Detection
- **DeepSORT** for Tracking
- **SwinIR** (Simulated) for Image Restoration

## Usage
1.  Start the network simulation to see nodes organizing and consuming energy.
2.  Upload a video in the "Analytics" section to see the server-side detection in action.

## Deployment
Running on Hugging Face Spaces with Docker.
